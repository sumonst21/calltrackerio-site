Sharing the same user account because a service charges per user is always a pain. That's what we added the ability to inivte unlimited users at no extra charge. We also have three levels of permissions that allow you to give limited access to users.

<strong>With our unlimited user features you can:</strong>
<ul class="list-unstyled features-list">
	<li><i class="material-icons text-success">check</i> Add multiple users to gain access to reports, calls and text messaging, and recieve notifications.</li>
    <li><i class="material-icons text-success">check</i> Add multiple admins to you account that can manage companies and trackers.</li>
    <li><i class="material-icons text-success">check</i> Ability to add company specific users who can only a company and it's reporiting.</li>
</ul>
