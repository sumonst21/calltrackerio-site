Over the last decade there has been an enormous amount of focus on digital marketing, tracking digital campaigns, search engine optimization, and analyzing web lead data for more effective marketing and better ROI. 

At the same time, most businesses are actively advertising through many differen't channels that may or may not be easy to track as web leads are. There has been however, one primary lead conversion channel that's alluded almost every marketer through all of this, **phone calls**.

##### The Marketer's big blind spot

 * What about the leads who called instead of submitting a form? (ie, most of them)
 * What if I do offline advertising on a billboard or a newspaper ad, how do I track that?

Until recently it's been virtually unknown to marketers what marketing campaign a sales leads came if the called. Then if a marketer needs to understand the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns they aren't able attribute any phone call into their ROI.

##### Some quick stats

* 88% of consumers who search for a type of local business on a mobile device call or go to that business within 24 hours. [Google Mobile Movement Study](http://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2011/04/smartphone-user-study-shows-mobile.html)

 * 95 percent of smartphone users have used their phone to look up local information. 
   * **After doing so, 61 percent called.** [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/11/12/fifty-essential-mobile-marketing-facts/)

With the number of mobile searches ever increasing, it's becomming more and more important understand how people got your phone number before they called, and that's just for web marketing.

##### Bridging the gap

Simply put, Call tracking allows you to fill in the gaps in your lead generation and conversion funnel. Call tracking allows you to easily purchase local or toll free numbers that can be used across your marketing campaigns, like billboards, newspaper ads, website landing pages, and then forward the callers to your actual phone number. 

Call tracking then records the campaign that each caller came from, giving you the marketing source attribution data. Now that you know where exactly conversions originated, you can accurately measure your ROI â€“ and ultimately this is going to help streamline your marketing budget. 

That's it, that's where we're at and that's why Calltracker is being born. We're on a mission to help marketers get this data and achieve better ROI on their marketing efforts.
