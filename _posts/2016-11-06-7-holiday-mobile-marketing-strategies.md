The holiday season is officially upon us, and with [more than half](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Most-Digital-Buyers-Will-Make-Purchases-via-Smartphone-by-2017/1013590) of today’s consumers expected to use their mobile devices to make online purchases over the coming weeks, there’s never been a better time to invest in mobile marketing. If you haven’t yet developed and launched a holiday mobile marketing strategy for your business, here are a few creative ideas to get you started.

**_Exclusive Coupons and Special Offers_** – [42 percent](http://go.kouponmedia.com/state-of-the-mobile-coupon-industry) of mobile users say they have used a mobile coupon, and 39 percent say they’re likely to spend more money as a result. If you’re not capitalizing on these facts, you’re leaving money on the table (and your competition is probably scooping it up). Give your prospects a reason to shop with you by offering them exclusive deals via their mobile devices. As a bonus, you can track coupon usage to gauge the success of each mobile campaign.

**_Personalized SMS Messages_** – Rather than resort to sending out blanket email blasts to your entire audience, segment them into groups for more targeted marketing messages. Leverage your CRM platform to find out what each segment’s purchasing habits and preferences are and then craft your messaging to align accordingly. The more personalized and targeted your marketing, the better your chances of converting those leads into holiday sales.

**_Well-Timed Push Notifications_** – Running a great holiday promo? Get the word out to the right people at the right time via mobile push notifications. This will allow you to capitalize on those individuals who are ready to buy while also keeping your brand top-of-mind for those who are still on the fence. Leverage push notifications about upcoming sales and other incentives to draw recent customers back in and tempt them into spending more.

**_Utilize Geo-Location for Impulse Buys_** – Want to attract more local shoppers into your brick-and-mortar store? Use geo-location capability to tap into this prime audience right where they are and entice them into stopping by. A last-minute deal or special “flash” sale that hits your prospective customers’ smartphones when they’re right near your shop can be an incredibly powerful tool for drawing in more business.

**_Holiday Gift-Giving Guide_** – Everyone has at least one person on their holiday shopping list who they struggle to buy for. Providing a portable gift-giving guide designed specifically for mobile devices can help feed your target audience ideas and influence their buying decisions. Not only will you increase the chances of making more sales, but your customers will appreciate the convenience and problem-solving you’ve provided them. Promote your guides via social channels and offer them as free downloads.

**_Updates and Alerts_** – Another great way to leverage mobile marketing during the holiday season is to offer the option for your customers and prospects to sign up and receive SMS updates and alerts about the products or services they’re looking for. That way they can be notified as soon as the gift they’re looking for is back in stock or has gone on sale. 

**_Creative and Fun Messaging_** – In an increasingly digital age, people crave a more personalized experience that connects them with the “human” side of brands. Mobile marketing provides an ideal vehicle for delivering this kind of experience, so remember to have fun and let your personality shine. Use holiday emojis, be creative with your voice and messaging and try to think of ways you can make an emotional connection with your target audience. 

With the holiday season in full force, the time to start implementing some mobile marketing strategies is now. Thanks to today’s technology, any business – regardless of size or industry – has the potential to reach more prospects, build customer loyalty and boost holiday sales. The above ideas should put you on the right path toward creating a campaign (or several) that will allow you to cash in and make this time of year especially festive for your bottom line.
