Call tracking or sometimes called "call capture" is a tool that businesses can use to track and record incoming phone calls from their marketing advertisments. In particular, it allows marketers to more accurately measure the results of the campaigns they run – including PPC, local SEO and even offline advertising - so that they can more effectively allocate and optimize their marketing spend. Here are a few specific problems that call tracking can provide resolution for:

**_Understanding which channels are driving which results. _**

Just because your phone is ringing doesn’t necessarily mean your campaigns are as effective as they could be. In fact, you could very well be wasting money, time and resources in the wrong areas while other areas have the potential to produce even better results. Call tracking software enables you to use a unique phone number for each campaign so you’ll be able to pinpoint exactly where your incoming calls are coming from. 

**_Choosing more targeted keywords._**

Keyword selection is a critical component of online marketing and call tracking software can enhance these efforts. When you are able to identify which ads are driving leads and conversions, you can trace that back to the keywords used to further optimize your efforts. This will ensure that your PPC campaigns are as effective as possible so you’re not wasting valuable resources in the process.

**_Determining which leads are qualified._**

Clicks on your ads and even calls to your business aren’t as valuable unless they’re likely to convert, and being able to figure out which incoming inquiries are the most qualified can provide insight into which campaigns are driving the best results. By using call tracker tools, like call recording, you can listen in on calls to find out where the most qualified leads are coming from. This way you can make appropriate changes to your campaigns and focus your efforts in the areas that are likely to drive the most conversions.

**_Maximizing marketing ROI._**

The more insight you can gain into which channels and campaigns are driving the best results (and which ones aren’t producing as hoped), the better you can hone your strategies. This will allow you to improve your return on investment in a much more targeted and effective manner. Essentially, call tracking removes much of the guesswork from the marketing planning process. The more accurate details you can attain from your marketing analysis, the better you can tweak and optimize your approach moving forward.

Of course, the best way to learn exactly what call tracking software is and what it can do for your business is to try it for yourself.
