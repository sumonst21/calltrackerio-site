Did you know that [95% of smartphone users](http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/11/12/fifty-essential-mobile-marketing-facts/#5364ee8f7b7e) have used their phones to look up local businesses? Furthermore, once these prospective customers found the companies they were looking for, 61% took action and called. 

It’s become abundantly clear that if you want to get your brand in front of more prospects, you have to find a way to reach them where they are, and that place is on their mobile devices. Yet, for whatever reason, many businesses still haven’t jumped on the mobile bandwagon. Some are concerned it will be too cost prohibitive. Others simply don’t know where to begin.

If you are among this group and have been resisting, here are five compelling reasons why incorporating mobile into your marketing strategy is an absolute must.

**Mobile Conversions &gt; Desktop Conversions**

The first reason why mobile marketing is so critical is because this type of marketing tends to generate more leads. Further, those leads tend to be more valuable in that they’re more likely to actually convert. Why? Because mobile searches lead to phone calls and inbound phone calls are [10-15 times](http://conversionsciences.com/blog/mobile-phone-calls-higher-conversion-rates/) more likely to convert than web searches. 

Mobile has essentially removed many of the barriers that are often present with traditional web marketing. Rather than having to fill out forms and search for contact information, mobile users can instantly get in touch with your business with one simple click. 

**You’ll Expand Your Reach**

[Twenty five percent](http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/11/12/fifty-essential-mobile-marketing-facts/#5364ee8f7b7e) of Americans are mobile-only web surfers, and that number is expected to continue to rise. Furthermore, [according to Google](https://adwords.googleblog.com/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html), even those who do have PCs prefer to conduct their web searches using their mobile devices. That means that if you’re focusing your efforts solely on traditional marketing techniques, you are missing out on the opportunity to reach a decent portion of prospective customers.

**Better Lead Nurturing**

In many instances, when a prospect comes across your brand, they won’t yet be ready to take action. In fact, experts believe it can take [6 to 8 “touches”](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2015/04/takes-6-8-touches-generate-viable-sales-lead-heres-why-gp.html) to successfully convert a lead into a paying customer. Mobile marketing provides additional opportunities to get your brand in front of your target audience more often. 

Why? Well, for one thing, [91 percent](http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/11/12/fifty-essential-mobile-marketing-facts/#5364ee8f7b7e) of adults have their smartphones within arm’s reach, and [50 percent](https://expresspigeon.com/blog/2014/01/06/email-marketing-statistics-2014/) grab their phones as soon as they wake up. Being so attached to their mobile devices naturally leads to increased exposure for your brand. More touches keep your brand top of mind and improve the chances that when your prospects are ready to convert, it’ll be your business they turn to.

**More Effective Benchmarking**

Thankfully, with today’s technology, mobile marketing has never been easier or more effective. It’s also never been so easy to measure the success of your campaigns. With [call tracking](https://calltracker.io/), you can get a clearer picture of where your leads are coming from, how well your strategies are working and where you might be able to improve for even better results. That means you’ll be better able to optimize your marketing budget for greater ROI. 

**Your Competition is Already There**

Given the fact that [68% of companies](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2015/01/2015-state-of-marketing.html) have already integrated mobile marketing into their overall marketing strategy, chances are very good that at least some of your competitors are a part of this statistic. In other words, your prospects are already being courted on their mobile devices by other businesses in your local area that offer the same products or services as you. 

If you aren’t throwing your hat into the ring, you’re essentially losing that competitive edge and missing out on profits as a result. It’s simple, really. Either keep up with the times or become obsolete. Which will you chose?
