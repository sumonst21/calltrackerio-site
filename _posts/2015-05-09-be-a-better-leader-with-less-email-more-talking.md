First, let me give some background about my experience. 

Don't get me wrong, **email is a critial tool for doing business**, I just don't think it's the best tool for business internally with people on your team that you work eith every day. A couple years ago I was asked to manage and develop our own in house software engineering team. At the time I was a young manager of our customer services team and learning the ropes of managing and honestly not doing a very good job at it. Myself, being an eager go-get-er accepted the new position and jumped in head first to a world of software engineering that I really didn't fully understand yet and my Leo Type A personality started making waves. 

My first few months we’re rough, I did everything wrong and made all of the wrong decisions. At the time we had a small Scrum team that was quite young and a Scum Master who really was trying to juggle leading software engineering and being the Scrum Master as the same time – really tough to do. Needless to say, it was a bit of a rocky start.

About 3 months into my new role I had a break, I finally got on the same playing field and communication plane as our Scrum Master. I look back on this moment or course of a few weeks where we started working together that I think it changed me on a personal level and was the beginning of a new chapter in my career. Looking back, up until that point in time I had been a really poor communicator to my team, and this was my biggest weakness as a manager. 

I did everything wrong in terms of communication. If you asked me the biggest thing I changed, **I stopped sending emails to my team**. OK, I still send some emails now and then for updates on things, but important communication and things that people need to know or give input on I started talking.

#### What’s wrong with email, why doesn’t it work?

The Harvard Business Review wrote a [great article](https://hbr.org/2011/11/dont-send-that-email-pick-up-t/) about the challenges of email that describes it more eloquently than I can. Simply put, here are some of the challenges I see with email. 

* [No one reads email](http://lifehacker.com/5964225/your-emails-are-too-long-heres-how-to-fix-them), seriously, people don’t read your email if it’s more than 5 sentences. [The most successful people only send short emails.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/26/email-successful-people_n_4854701.html)
* If the email is about an important issue, your email is going to have less impact as a face to face meeting. In the end, email is impersonal.
* Email can have counterintuitive reactions, because it’s hard to get EQ right (Are you a published literary author?) in your email you might provoke the wrong reaction.

#### How to effectively manage without email

I’m not the world’s foremost thought leaders on management, leadership, or communication but here are some simple things that I’ve found to effectively manage a team without email.

#### Have a short meeting every morning.

Get your team together and one by one, go over what happened yesterday and what needs to happen today, you as a manager can add some quick input if you need to but keep it short and follow up with people you need to in person afterwards. As a manager you can use this time when everyone is together to talk about any important updates that you previously might have sent out via email.

Anyone who’s ever practiced Agile or Scrum will know this as the morning standup meeting but this type of morning meeting is common across all industries in some form or another. It’s only the new technology companies that seem to have gotten away from this, people need face to face communication every day. 

#### Use a Task board and prioritize it.

There are hundreds of task apps out there, some of my favorites are Trello and Asana. The important thing is to create a backlog of things to do and put the important things at the top. Instead of writing an email to do something, create a quick task and prioritize it accordingly. Having a prioritized list of things to do helps your team stay focused on what’s important and not get distracted by a random email that may or may not be important than what they are working on, they don’t know so they just lose time reading your email.
	
#### Instead of writing an email, just go talk to that person.

If you have something important that needs to be taken care of in a relatively short time, go talk to your team about it. If you've got something to tell the team, tell them in the morning meeting you have everyday. If something comes up you need taken care of, don't send an email, go talk to them and be straight to the point about what you need and have a conversation with that person about the next steps. If you’d sent an email, you probably wouldn't have lost time going back and forth discussing what the next best step is when a conversation would have been faster.

I hope this post inspires you to stop and think before you send that next long email to your team, start talking, and ultimately becoming a more effective communicator. If you do send out a mail, don’t forget to keep it short, and straight to the point. Who knows, you might just end up becoming a better leader for your team.
