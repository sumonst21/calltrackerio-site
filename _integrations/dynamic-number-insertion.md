<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_keyword_insertion" target="_blank">Dynamic Number Insertion</a> (DNI) is the core engine behind effective call tracking for digital marketers for your website and landing pages. DNI will automatically swap your real phone number with a tracking number in real time. With our DNI integration setup on your website, you'll be able to harness the full power of our call tracking to target visitors based on different traffic sources, landing pages, campaigns, and also keywords with our number pools. 

##### Benefits of Dynamic Number Insertion
* **Hassel Free Call Tracking** - DNI drastically simplifies managing tracking numbers shown on your website allowing you to manage them from your Call Tracker Account and not on your website.
* **Target Source Channels** - Specific visitor targeting based on search engine, organic or paid search, referring domain, campaign parameters, landing page, and direct visitors. 
* **Google Adwords Integration** - Our Google Adwords integration is built on top of our DNI to work seemlessly together. 

##### How It Works

Our DNI integration requires that you place one line of javascript on all pages on your site that you want to automatically swap out your real number. With most websites, this can be done in a matter of a few minutes and then you're setup to go. We also have a WordPress plugin that helps install our DNI on your WordPress based website.
