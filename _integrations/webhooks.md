Webhooks allow software engineers to receive real-time event notifications to use in their application or reporting system. With Webhooks, we are able to solve a common problem when building integrations require software engineers to "Poll" for new data, allowing them to instead "Subscribe" to data which is much more efficient and faster for real-time application integration.

We provide several events that developers can subscribe to keey their system in sync with events happening in their Call Tracker account, see our <a href="https://app.calltracker.io/help/article/webhooks/">Webhooks Documentation</a> for more.
