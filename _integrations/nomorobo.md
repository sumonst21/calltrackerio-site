#### Finally! No more annoying robocalls and telemarketers.

Call Tracker is able to identify and stop robocallers before the unwanted call wastes your time through our integration with Nomorobo. Every call through Call Tracker  is screened by the Nomorobo before being forwarded preventing these annoying calls from disrupting your day. **The best part is, this is part of our platform at no extra cost.**

##### About Nomorobo
<a href="https://www.nomorobo.com/" target="_blank">Nomorobo</a> is the industry leading anti-robocall platform having stopped over 800 million robocalls since their launch in 2013. Nomorobo also won the nationwide FTC Robocall Challenge (<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2013/04/robocall-challenge-and-winner" target="_blank">source</a>) as the best technology to handle the rampant robocallers.

##### How does it work?
Our platform uses Nomorobo to identify calls that are from robocallers and telemarketers. If a call is flagged as a robocall, it is then processed through your company settings for handling robocalls.

**There are two ways to handle robocalls:**
* **Challenge -** force the caller to Press 1 to continue and connect the call to ensure its a real human.
* **Block -** calls will be immediately ended with no option to connect the call.

We recommend challenging calls over blocking, its better to allow a call to come through if it's human than get totally blocked.

##### Setup & Installation
Nomorobo is automatically setup on every account, so there is nothing for you to add or enable, just sit back, relax, and focus on the calls the matter.
